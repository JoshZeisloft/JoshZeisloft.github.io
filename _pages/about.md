I am currently a final semester undergraduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, majoring in mechanical engineering and minoring in robotics. I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA and moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2019. In my free time I enjoy lifting, rock climbing, travel and car restoration.

What I'm looking for
======
I am currently looking for a full-time position, starting in January 2023. I will be graduating Georgia Tech in December 2022, with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a minor in robotics. My main focus is CAD and design of mechaincal systems (specifically for robotics), but I am aslo passionate about controls and manufacturing.

What I can offer
======
As I have worked towards my degree at Georgia Tech, I have had the opportunity to collaborate on several research, class, and personal projects. I have encountered many engineering problems in both group and individual settings. These challenges have helped me to learn creative problem solving and leading a team to a successful end product. These experiences, along with my academic achievement, have solidified my passion to pursue a career in the field of engineering. 

During past internships, I had the opportunity to learn from industry professionals, in a start-up environment, working on product design and development. I was involved in every step of the process, from idea conception to final product launch. In additional to the technical experiences, these opportunities enabled me to sharpen my leadership, public speaking, and collaboration skills, while making essential contributions to these teams.

My passion for engineering is my main driving factor, and the urge to be a part of something incredible is what has lead me to seek out these opportunities. I am eager to provide my demonstrated technical skill, professionalism, dedication, and integrity to any company willing to let me grow my engineering skill with them.
