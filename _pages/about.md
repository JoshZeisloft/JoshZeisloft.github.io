I am currently a robotics engineer at SRG Global, an automotive manufacturing comapny. I graduated the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022 and majored in mechanical engineering and minored in robotics. I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA and moved to Atlanta, Georgia in 2019. In my free time I enjoy lifting, rock climbing, travel and car restoration.

What I'm looking for
======
I am seeking full-time opportunities related to robotics with an emphasis on mechanical design and testing. In the field on robotics, I am mainly looking for the opportunity to work on space robotics applications.

What I can offer
======
As a robotics engineer with experience in the automotive manufacturing industry, I have developed a unique set of skills that I believe are highly transferable to the field of space robotics. Throughout my career, I have been deeply focused on designing and programming robots with a strong emphasis on reliability, a critical trait when dealing with complex systems in challenging environments.

In my work, I have developed a deep understanding of how to create systems that are resilient, efficient, and safe, which are all key requirements in the field of space robotics. I have extensive experience in designing and programming robots that can operate effectively in harsh conditions, such as those encountered in automotive manufacturing plants. I have also developed a keen eye for detail, which has allowed me to identify and address potential issues before they become major problems.

One of my core strengths is my ability to collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams. I believe that successful robotics projects require close collaboration between engineers, programmers, and other stakeholders. Over the years, I have honed my communication skills and developed a knack for understanding the perspectives of different team members. This has allowed me to work effectively with everyone from mechanical engineers to software developers, ensuring that our projects are completed on time and within budget.

Another key skill that I bring to the table is my ability to think creatively and innovate in order to solve complex problems. As a robotics engineer, I am constantly faced with new challenges and obstacles that require me to think outside the box. This ability to think creatively has been invaluable in my work, and I am confident that it will serve me well in the field of space robotics. 

My passion for engineering is my main driving factor, and the urge to be a part of something incredible is what has lead me to seek out these opportunities. I am eager to provide my demonstrated technical skill, professionalism, dedication, and integrity to a company where I can contribute my talents while continuing to develop my skill set.
