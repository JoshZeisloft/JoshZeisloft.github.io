I am currently an automation engineer at Adient, an automotive seating manufacturing comapny. I graduated the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2022, where I majored in mechanical engineering and minored in robotics. I am originally from Pittsburgh, PA and moved to Atlanta, GA in 2019. In my free time I enjoy lifting, running, rock climbing, travel and car restoration.

What I'm looking for
======
I am seeking full-time opportunities with an emphasis on mechanical design and testing. In the field on robotics, I am mainly looking for the opportunity to work on robotic cells for manufacturing improvement. Ideally, working as an integrator or in-house integrator, being a part of the entire design, build, program and test cycle. I have been working with industrial robots since 2018, when I had my first internship at an integration company, creating demos for customers.
