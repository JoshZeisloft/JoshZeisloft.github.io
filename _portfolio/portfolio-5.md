Designed, built, programmed, and tested an assembly cell for head-count reduction. The design of the clip "spindles" was created to acheive the strick cycel time of 60 seconds for 24 components. There are two identical machines that run 90% OEE and came in $100,000 underbudget due to may unique design and aggresive schedule for completing the project. The machine itself has many features that allow for minimal downtime where the robot and spindles will fix themselves if an issue arises to prevent someone from going over to fix it, this has helped contribute to the high OEE.
