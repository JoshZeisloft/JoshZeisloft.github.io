Created a path planning algorithm in MATLAB to be used for a standard Turtlebot robot programmed in ROS. This algorithm impletmented a RRT path-planning graph search algorithm and localization with LIDAR, encoders and a gyroscope. It could find a path for the robot to traverse around 6 lab desk in the room.
