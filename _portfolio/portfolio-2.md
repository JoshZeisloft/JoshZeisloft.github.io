Created a path planning algorithm in MATLAB to be used for a standard Turtlebot robot programmed in ROS. This algorithm implements a RRT path-planning graph search algorithm and localization with LIDAR, encoders and a gyroscope. It can find a safe path for the robot to traverse between two given points, while avoiding 6 lab desks and any unknown objects in the room.
