In the process of creating a robotic gripper for use on a future Mars lander, tasked with collecting sample tubes off the Martian surface. This gripper will have a unique mechanical design and pickup process, in order to use the least amount of energy possible. The team will aim to create as close to a usable design as possible, that would actual function in space, given the price limit and skill level of the class.
