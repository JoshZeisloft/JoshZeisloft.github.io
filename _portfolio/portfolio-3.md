In the process of creating a robotic arm for use on a future Mars lander, tasked with collecting smaple tubes off the Martian surface. This arm will have cleaning capabilities in order to ensure no contamination due to Martian dust. The team will aim to create as close to a usable design as possible, that would actual function in space, given the price limit and skill level of the class.
