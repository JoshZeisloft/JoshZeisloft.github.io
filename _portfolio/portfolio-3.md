Created a robotic gripper for use on a future Mars lander, tasked with collecting sample tubes off the Martian surface. This gripper has a unique mechanical design and pickup process, in order to use the least amount of energy possible. The design has two actuations from a single gripper, allowing for the pickup of two sample tubes per loading cycle. Our design showed to be 30% more efficient than the NASA design for the same task. The team created a workable solution, as close to a usable design as possible, that would actually function in space, given the price limit and skill level of the class.
